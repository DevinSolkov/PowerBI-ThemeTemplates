# Repository Reorganization Plan

## Objectives
- Align the repository to the developer-focused structure defined in the Organize Repo prompt.
- Normalize naming to lower_snake_case where practical.
- Centralize code, inputs, outputs, samples, and documentation so automation scripts can resolve stable paths.

## Planned Moves
| Source | Destination | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1.Visual Templates/*.json` | `themes/inputs/visual_templates/` (renamed to lower_snake_case) | Treat per-visual templates as raw inputs for theme generation. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Rainwater Theme v4.1*.json` | `themes/outputs/rainwater/v4_1/` (rename variants to lower_snake_case) | Group all Rainwater deliverables by client/version for easier promotion. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Rainwater Theme v4.1.backup.json` | `themes/outputs/rainwater/v4_1/_archive/rainwater_theme_v4_1_backup.json` | Preserve backup under explicit archive namespace. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Virginia Forest.json` | `themes/outputs/virginia_forest/virginia_forest.json` | Keep alternative client theme in outputs with normalized name. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Spend Cube/03_templates/*.json` | `themes/outputs/spend_cube/templates/` (rename to lower_snake_case) | Maintain Spend Cube deliverables beside other outputs for reuse. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Spend Cube/01_overview/*.md` | `docs/projects/spend_cube/overview/` | Treat narrative overview as project documentation. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Spend Cube/01_overview/spend-cube-overview.machine.txt` | `docs/projects/spend_cube/overview/overview.machine.md` | Normalize machine-readable summary with markdown extension. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Spend Cube/01_overview/spend-cube-inventory.json` | `reports/spend_cube/inventory.json` | Move quantitative inventory into reports for analytical artifacts. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Spend Cube/02_properties/visual-properties.csv` | `reports/spend_cube/visual_properties.csv` | Keep CSV dataset with other reports outputs. |
| `2.Custom Themes/Spend Cube/02_properties/visual-properties-human.txt` | `docs/projects/spend_cube/properties/visual_properties.notes.md` | Preserve human notes alongside project docs. |
| `3.Sample Files/*` | `themes/samples/` (retain PBIP folder names, normalized to lower_snake_case) | Keep PBIP exports as sample inputs for testing. |
| `4.Documentation/*.md` (non-legacy) | `docs/` (rename to lower_snake_case) | Consolidate guidance, FAQ, and contribution docs. |
| `4.Documentation/.gitignore` | Remove | Obsolete after docs consolidation. |
| `4.Documentation/legacy/README_1.1.md` | `docs/legacy/README_1.1.md` | Preserve historical README under docs legacy. |
| `_reports/*` | `reports/` (subfolders: `datasets`, `diffs`, `scorecards`, `table_matrix`, `summaries`) | Standardize analytics under reports namespace. |
| `repo_tree.txt` (root) | `reports/legacy/repo_tree_legacy.txt` | Archive legacy inventory snapshot. |
| `reportThemeSchema-2.114.json` | `themes/inputs/schemas/report_theme_schema-2_114.json` | House schema resources with other inputs. |
| `tests/testSchema.json` | `themes/inputs/schemas/test_schema.json` | Keep validation fixtures with theme schemas. |
| `tools/*.py` | `src/scripts/` (rename to lower_snake_case if needed) | Treat scripts as source transformations. |
| `tools/__pycache__` | Remove | Generated bytecode should not be tracked. |
| `5.Prompts/*.xml` | `docs/prompts/` | Keep agent prompts accessible with project documentation. |
| `_reports/scorecards` | `reports/scorecards/` | Maintain scoreboard per target structure. |
| `inventory_before.txt` | stay root (new) | Captures pre-org snapshot per instructions. |

## New Artifacts
- `themes/MANIFEST.json` enumerating input templates, schema versions, and output targets.
- `docs/index.md` linking to setup, build, schema, conventions, and prompts collections.
- Folder-level `README.md` and optional `README.machine.md` in `themes/`, `src/`, `docs/`, and `reports/`.
- Updated root `README.md` and new `README.machine.md` summarizing automation steps.
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry describing the reorg.

## Path Reference Updates
- Update Python scripts in `src/scripts/` to use new paths for prompts, schemas, outputs, and reports.
- Refresh JSON references in Spend Cube templates to point at `themes/samples/` directories.
- Align GitHub workflow paths if they reference moved locations.

## Snapshot Tasks
- Preserve `inventory_before.txt` created at start of reorg.
- Generate `inventory_after.txt` once moves complete to document the resulting tree.
